## What's New in 2.0

Version 2.0 is a proper update with significant improvements:

- **Redesigned UI** that feels cleaner
- **Native VS Code extension** for seamless integration
- **New commands** that solve real problems
- **Claude Agent SDK** renamed with dynamic subagents (`--agents` flag)

The magic is in the smaller things that improve everyday use.
